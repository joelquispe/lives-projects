# Tetris Game

## Overview
This is a basic implementation of the classic Tetris game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a simple user interface and standard Tetris gameplay mechanics.

## Files
- `src/index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the game, including the game board and controls.
- `src/styles.css`: Defines the styles for the game board, tetrominoes, and other UI elements.
- `src/app.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for game initialization, rendering, user input, collision detection, line clearing, and game over conditions.

## How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys to move the tetrominoes:
   - Left Arrow: Move left
   - Right Arrow: Move right
   - Down Arrow: Move down faster
   - Up Arrow: Rotate the tetromino
2. The objective is to fill horizontal lines with blocks. When a line is filled, it will disappear, and you will earn points.
3. The game ends when the tetrominoes stack up to the top of the game board.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `src/index.html` in your web browser to start playing.

## Notes
- This implementation is a basic version of Tetris and can be expanded with additional features such as scoring, levels, and sound effects.
- Feel free to modify the code and enhance the game as you wish!
